# ML-for-oceanography
 Predict ocean wave length using regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or SVR. Gather oceanic data including wind speed, wave height. Evaluate using metrics like MAE, MSE. Tune models for accuracy by experimenting with feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.
